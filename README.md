# 💻 Solving Technical Interview Challenges

I created this repository so I can upload and keep track of some technical interview challenges that I'll be solving until I get an internship.

## 📋 Goal
My main goal is to:
- 📚 **Regiter my studies and progress.**
- 🔍 **Keep the challenges organized and centralized for me.**

Feel free to take a look at my solutions. 

> **Note:** Some challenges may not contain a link or detailed instructions about the context, but some of them are from big companys so you can probably find them online.

## 🚀 Tools and Technology
I will be focusing in solving challenges using the tech below:
- **Java**
- **Spring**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **JUNIT and Mockito**
- **Docker**
